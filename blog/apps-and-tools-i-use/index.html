They help me getting stuff done, and I recommend them all to you.</p>
<p><a href="#-alfred-https-www-alfredapp-com-">Alfred</a>, <a href="#-shortcat-https-shortcatapp-com-">Shortcat</a>, and <a href="#-hammerspoon-https-www-hammerspoon-org-">Hammerspoon</a> let me do almost anything without touching the mouse. <a href="#-pocket-https-getpocket-com-">Pocket</a>, <a href="#-evernote-https-evernote-com-">Evernote</a>, and <a href="#-dropbox-https-www-dropbox-com-">Dropbox</a> are where I put things so that they&#39;re synced in the cloud. <a href="#-1password-https-1password-com-">1Password</a> remembers all my passwords online. I use <a href="#-tadam-http-tadamapp-com-">Tadam</a> to pace my work, and <a href="#-rescuetime-https-www-rescuetime-com-">RescueTime</a> to monitor where I&#39;m spending my time on. On my phone, <a href="#-productive-http-productiveapp-io-">Productive</a> helps me work on my habits and routines, and <a href="#-spark-https-sparkmailapp-com-">Spark</a> moves towards inbox zero. When coding and writing I spend most of my time in <a href="#-iterm-https-www-iterm2-com-">iTerm</a> and <a href="#-vim-https-www-vim-org-">Vim</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-alfred-https-www-alfredapp-com-"><a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a></h2>
<p>Alfred allows you to <strong>use hotkeys and keywords to open apps and run workflows</strong>. It has a minimalistic interface, a text field you can summon using an hotkey, I use <code>Option</code> <code>Space</code>. From there you start typing what you&#39;d like to do and Alfred smart text expansion will match the most likely target.</p>
<p>Some of the workflows I use most often are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Alfred to launch apps without having to find them in the applications folder. Type <code>x</code> and my first result is Xcode.</li>
<li><code>s &lt;word&gt;</code> to see the definition of a word, it&#39;s fuzzy so I don&#39;t have to spell it right.</li>
<li><code>spf</code> to reveal an interface that shows the information about the track currently playing in Spotify without having to navigate to it. It also allows to pause or play the track.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alfred has a <strong>Clipboard history</strong> feature which can store anything you&#39;ve copied and let you search through it. You can copy multiple things from a page, move to the other and then use the clipboard history to paste them. Much more effective than switching between apps all the time.</p>
<h2 id="-shortcat-https-shortcatapp-com-"><a href="https://shortcatapp.com/">Shortcat</a></h2>
<p>With Shortcat you can <strong>use the keyboard to click element in the screen</strong>. Using a configurable hotkey, like <code>Shift</code> <code>Cmd</code> <code>Space</code>, you can bring up a text input where to write the name of the element in the screen you want to click.</p>
<p>Shortcat has fuzzy matching and uses the accessibility identifiers of the elements on screen, making it accurate and efficient at finding what you&#39;re typing.</p>
<h2 id="-hammerspoon-https-www-hammerspoon-org-"><a href="https://www.hammerspoon.org/">Hammerspoon</a></h2>
<p>Hammerspoon is an open source &quot;bridge between the operating system and a Lua scripting engine&quot;. I use it as <strong>window manager</strong>, with hotkey sequences to move my window to half of the screen to the left, half to the right, etc.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t need to know Lua to configure Hammerspoon. I don&#39;t know it either and still managed to configure <a href="https://github.com/mokagio/dotfiles/tree/HEAD/hammerspoon_init.lua">my setup</a> the way I wanted it. Just play around with the code in the examples of the <a href="http://www.hammerspoon.org/go/#winmoveintro">documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-tadam-http-tadamapp-com-"><a href="http://tadamapp.com/">Tadam</a></h2>
<p>Tadam is a <strong>minimalistic timer</strong> inspired by the <a href="https://francescocirillo.com/pages/pomodoro-technique">Pomodoro technique</a>. It stays out of your way while counting down, then gets in your face when the time is up.</p>
<p>I love it because it solves a problem I often have. I plan to time box things to take regular breaks, but always end up getting stuck in them, or starting something else once done. Before I know it an hours has passed and I haven&#39;t taken any break.</p>
<p>Tadam shows an alert that takes up most of the center of the screen, on top of every window. It is a great way to force yourself to take breaks and give your brain a bit of fresh air, making you more productive later.</p>
<h2 id="-rescuetime-https-www-rescuetime-com-"><a href="https://www.rescuetime.com/">RescueTime</a></h2>
<p>RescueTime <strong>tracks the time you spend on each app</strong> and generates reports on it. Tracking how time is spent is the first step to become more productive, as it reveals what you actually do compared to what you <em>think</em> you do.</p>
<p>Tracking how time is spent is the first step towards using time wisely. It reveals what you actually do compared to what you <em>think</em> you do.</p>
<p>It can give you some tough love showing you how many hours you&#39;ve spent on social media while you thought you were working hard.</p>
<h2 id="-evernote-https-evernote-com-"><a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a></h2>
<p>There are two parts of a trusted system for collecting notes. It has to be easy to add notes, and it has to be easy to find them out later. <a href="https://evernote.com/">Evernote</a> has a bloated UI and doesn&#39;t yet support <a href="http://commonmark.org/help/">Markdown</a> editing, but makes it all up with how with its <strong>powerful search through notes and OCRed images</strong>.</p>
<p>I use it every day, scan my receipts with it too, and haven&#39;t needed to upgrade to the Pro version yet</p>
<h2 id="-dropbox-https-www-dropbox-com-"><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/">Dropbox</a></h2>
<p>Most of my file system lives either on a Git server or on Dropbox. I use Dropbox to back up all the pictures taken with our phones as well. It&#39;s good peace of mind, and comes in handy when switching computers, or when on the go without one.</p>
<h2 id="-1password-https-1password-com-"><a href="https://1password.com/">1Password</a></h2>
<p>When I was younger I had what I thought was a smart &quot;algorithm&quot; to compute the password for a website using some properties of that website. I felt smart for not having problems remembering passwords, and always using a different one. My system worked fine, but it was silly, not to mention vulnerable and insecure.</p>
<p>Using a password manager is a better option. You only need to remember one -long and memorable, but hard to crack- password, and that&#39;s it. It will generate and store all your passwords from you, doing a much better job at coming up with hard to break passwords than you or I can.</p>
<p>I use 1Password to store all my passwords, together with MFA on any site that supports it. The experience of using it is becoming almost frictionless, even on mobile. I love it. I really encourage you to start using a password manager.</p>
<h2 id="-iterm-https-www-iterm2-com-"><a href="https://www.iterm2.com/">iTerm</a></h2>
<p>iTerm is a more <strong>powerful terminal application than the stock macOS one</strong>. It offers split panes, infinite scrolling, searching with mouseless copy, and <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/features.html">much more</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-vim-https-www-vim-org-"><a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a></h2>
<p>Whenever I can I write using Vim. In fact I&#39;m writing this using it, in <a href="#iterm">iTerm</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Modal editing</strong> is an effective way to write and edit any kind of text. Not having to use the mouse to move around the page is great. Plus there are many <strong>plug-ins</strong> for any kind of job, which allows you to configure Vim to serve your needs, like a tailor made shirt.</p>
<h2 id="-productive-http-productiveapp-io-"><a href="http://productiveapp.io/">Productive</a></h2>
<p>I use this little app on my iPhone to <strong>track habits</strong> that I&#39;m building and daily routines. It lets you set times of the day when you&#39;d like to do certain things, as well as recurring habits. There are so many things I have to do on a regular basis but always forget, Productive helps me with them.</p>
<h2 id="-pocket-https-getpocket-com-"><a href="https://getpocket.com">Pocket</a></h2>
<p>Any article I find interesting or I&#39;d like to read later I save to Pocket, possibly with a tag. I realise there might be a flaw in this process because the rate at which I save things in is far bigger that the one at which I read things out. Still, it&#39;s a great tool to store articles and find them later.</p>
<p>They recently added an <strong>highlight</strong> feature on mobile. It&#39;s handy to be able to highlight parts of posts and only look at those later.</p>
<h2 id="-spark-https-sparkmailapp-com-"><a href="https://sparkmailapp.com/">Spark</a></h2>
<p>Spark is a nice <strong>email client</strong> for both iOS and macOS, although I use it only on my phone. I like the snooze feature, and the integration with Pocket and other services to save links from emails.</p>
<h2 id="-tripmode-https-www-tripmode-ch-"><a href="https://www.tripmode.ch/">TripMode</a></h2>
<p>I do a fair bit of train commuting and have unreliable wired connection at home so I tether often. TripMode allows you to <strong>select which apps should access the network when connected via your phone</strong>. It avoids wasting bandwidth, and money. You might be surprised by this, but a country like Australia doesn&#39;t offer an all-you-can-eat data plan, not for a reasonable amount of money at least.</p>
<hr>
<p>Apps and tools will not suddenly make you more productive. Productivity is first of all a mindset, it&#39;s a set of behaviours and habits that you need to keep working on all the time. What apps and tools can do though is <strong>help you leverage those productive behaviour becoming more efficient and organized at what you do</strong>.</p>
