and discovered that to do so I&#39;d have to generate the static html manually because
the plugin wasn&#39;t safe.</p>
<p>That &quot;manuality&quot; defied the purpose of Jekyll itself, publish new posts just with a push,
so caught in a mix of annoyance and spirit of exploration I decided to look towards the Javascript scene.</p>
<p><a href="metalsmith.io">Metalsmith</a> promised to be lightweight and easy to use, so i jumped
into a migration process that turned out not to be the good idea that I thought it was.</p>
<h3 id="meet-metalsmith">Meet Metalsmith</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.metalsmith.io/">Metalsmith</a> is a Node.js package for static website generation,
based on the use of plugins.</p>
<p>The way Metalsmith works is simple yet effective, it reads all the files in a source folder,
invokes a series of plugins that manipulate those files, and finally writes the results
on a destination folder.</p>
<p>The team behind Metalsmith and the community have developed a vast array of plugins,
making the task of creating a static website a matter of composing the right plugins.</p>
<p>Using <a href="https://github.com/lsjroberts/gelatin-design">gelatin-design</a> as an example
I rebuilt mokacoding one plugin at a time.
I&#39;ve released the result as <a href="https://github.com/mokagio/metallo.js">metallo.js</a>,
the static blog generator you should not use.</p>
<h3 id="the-smith-is-still-an-apprentice">The smith is still an apprentice</h3>
<p>What I discovered by working on it is that metalsmith is not a mature software at all,
and it&#39;s core feature, the plugin structure is a bit fragile.
The problem is that it&#39;s not hard to encounter a setup where a plugin parses data
making assumptions on it, but those assumptions are wrong because another plugin has
been added to the pipeline and changed that same data.
I could find no documentation regarding this issue.
The problem itself is not an easy one, how can a plugin determine if the assumption
it&#39;s making are reliable, or how can a plugin inform the other plugins in the pipeline
that it changed the data in a way that could cause unexpected results?
As long as there are only and handful of plugins in the pipeline it&#39;s simple to
spot the issue, but it gets harder the more plugins you use.</p>
<p>Of course I could have realised all this about the state of the platform by spending
more than just a couple of minutes through the READMEs, and maybe checking out the
issues as well... <em>Facepalm</em>.</p>
<p>But you&#39;re reading this blog post from a Metalsmith powered blog, so despite not being
a piece of cake, blogging with metalsmith is possible.
So why was it such a not so smart idea to drop Jekyll? The keywords are three: time, content and hosting.</p>
<h3 id="time">Time</h3>
<p>Our time is limited, and we have to juggle it the best way possible.
I spent way more time that I wanted working on metallo.js.
Yes it was fun and a good learning experience, and yes I think I achieved the result
of making my blog and workflow at least slightly better.
But it took me longer than hoped, and I&#39;m now left with a consistent backlog.</p>
<p>One word is very important in the previous sentence, <strong>hoped</strong>.
Being a personal project I didn&#39;t do any planning, I just thought and hoped that
it wouldn&#39;t take long. As we all know developers are the worst people to ask for estimates.</p>
<p><em>Fail!</em> If I had planned a bit I would have set a timebox and a list of experiments
to do before starting with the migration.
Doing so I would have discovered that this approach wasn&#39;t what I actually wanted,
while still having fun and learning... <em>Facepalm</em>, again.</p>
<h3 id="content">Content</h3>
<p>Blogging is, or should be, about the content, not the medium!
Even if this is a tech blog, the people that read this blog are interested in the
content of the posts, not on the fact that they&#39;ve been generated by parsing markdown
file and rendered with zero code duplication thanks to the view templates.
The time I spend on this blog should be focused only on making the content better.</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a message to all the devs that like me have a blog that they use to store
some thoughts, and that like me couldn&#39;t handle the idea of using <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">tumblr</a> or <a href="https://medium.com/">medium</a>
because of the &quot;i can write it better&quot; syndrome.
<strong>Forget about the medium, focus on the content!</strong></p>
<h3 id="hosting">Hosting</h3>
<p>Now for a less philosophical consideration.
I&#39;m lazy and poor, so I <a href="https://pages.github.com/">host my blog for free on GitHub</a>.
If you want to use GitHub to host your static blog than Jekyll is the way to go.
It&#39;s the software they recommend and all the integrations an nice features are build for it.
Embrace it.</p>
<p>This is why I shouldn&#39;t have stopped using Jekyll.
But let&#39;s face it this blog is my playground and I&#39;m gonna keep messing around with it!
I&#39;ve learned the lesso though, and I&#39;ll kept it in mind for the future!</p>
<p><em>Have fun hacking your planned and timeboxed next project!</em></p>
