      ## Hey there ðŸ‘‹

      Hi I'm [Gio](https://gio.codes).
      I'm a dad, and writer of software and words.
      In this blog, I ramble about testing, automation, and productivity for software developers.

      I'm pretty into TDD.
      In fact, I wrote a whole book about it!
      Check it out: [_Test-Driven Development in Swift with SwiftUI and Combine_](https://tddinswift.com/).
