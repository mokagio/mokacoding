**Update:** I published a post version of the talk, [check it out](http://mokacoding.com/blog/functional-core-reactive-shell).

These are some links and credits for my recent talk "Functional Core, Reactive Shell", also called "Pizza Driven Development".

[Ken Scambler](https://twitter.com/kenscambler) has done some great work in providing a constructive critique to mocks and stubs, and how to write code that doesn't need them.

[Gary Bernhardt](https://twitter.com/garybernhardt?lang=en) has been the first, as far as I know, to develop the idea of "Functional Core, Imperative Shell".

- [DAS Screencast Season 4, with "Functional Core, Imperative Shell" episode](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog#season4)

Without the work inspirational work of Ken and Gary my talk wouldn't have
existed, and I'm very grateful to them for sharing those idea with the world on
the internet.
