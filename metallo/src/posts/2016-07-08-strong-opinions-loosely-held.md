The other day I was listening to [Giant Robots Smashing into Other Giant Robots
Podcast #199](http://giantrobots.fm/199), when co-host [Chris
Toomey](https://twitter.com/christoomey) said that that one of the reason he
loves working for [Thoughtbot](https://thoughtbot.com/) is the mindset.

He mentioned three elements of this mindset that I found
incredibly powerful and
think are very important. I decided to capture them in this little post, to
remind myself and share them with you:

> Strong opinions loosely held.
>
> Nothing is set in stone.
>
> The answer can never be "because that's the way we've always done it".

I'll try to keep these close to my heart. I think this kind of mindset is
valuable not only in the software development business, but in life in general.

That's all ðŸ˜Š
