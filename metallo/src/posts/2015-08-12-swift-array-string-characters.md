Sometimes you might need to get an array of characters out of a String, for example:

```
"foo bar" => ["f", "o", "o", " ", "b", "a", "r"]
```

To do so you can do:

```swift
"foo bar".map { String($0) }
```

or if you are into point free notation:

```swift
"foo bar".map(String.init)
```

There you go. ðŸ˜Ž
