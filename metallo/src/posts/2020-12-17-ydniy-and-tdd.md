title: 'How to be more effective at Test-Driven Development by asking "Do I need this yet?"'

What do YDNIY and TDD have in common?
They're both acronyms. ü•Å

Jokes aside, "You Don't Need It Yet" and "Test-Driven Development" are both techniques that shift the focus on moving fast and incrementally.
In fact, applying the YDNIY mindset when practicing TDD will make you more effective at it.

[I already wrote about the value of YDNIY](https://mokacoding.com/blog/you-dont-need-it-yet/), a concept [defined by Itamar Turner-Trauring](https://codewithoutrules.com/2020/09/18/ydniy/).
It's a highly iterative approach for shipping software on a schedule.

When deciding what to build and ship, ask yourself whether you need all of the features you planned right now or if you can still deliver value to the users with only some of them.
Can you work on a subset of the requirement first and deliver the rest in future updates?

As a byproduct of applying the YDNIY mindset, you'll get real world feedback on your software faster <sup id="fn-feedback-caveat-back"><a href="#fn-feedback-caveat">1</a></sup>.
This focus on fast feedback made it immediately resonate with me.
Fast feedback is at the core of another favorite of mine: Test-Driven Development.

In [_Test-Driven Development By Example_](https://geni.us/NwUB1Ns), Kent Beck introduces Red/Green/Refactor as follows:

> 1. Red: Write a little test that doesn't work, and perhaps doesn't even compile at first.
>
> 2. Green: Make the test work quickly, committing whatever sins necessary in the process.
>
> 3. Refactor: Eliminate all of the duplication created in merely getting the test to work.

You write a little test and you aim to make it pass fast, "committing whatever sins necessary in the process."

Building software driven by tests requires continually asking yourself, "do I need it yet?"
The focus is on getting the simple test you just wrote to pass first.
Doing that establishes a green baseline from which you can safely perform small refactors to refine the implementation.

My upcoming book [_TDD in Swift_](https://bit.ly/tdd-in-swift) introduces Test-Driven Development concepts by building a "real-world" menu ordering app for an Italian restaurant.

The journey starts with a simplification exercise: what do we need to build _something_ valuable for the users?
What's our [Earliest Testable version](https://blog.crisp.se/2016/01/25/henrikkniberg/making-sense-of-mvp)?

Do we need an API to read the menu?
Not yet, we can start with hardcoding it in the app.
Do we need a fancy UI with animations?
Not yet, we can use stock SwiftUI components and focus on building the business logic.
An so on...

The same goes for writing the code that makes the tests pass.
One of the exercises in the book is adding a spiciness visual indicator when displaying the name of each spicy item<sup id="fn-example-back"><a href="#fn-example">2</a></sup>.

Here's the test for the "adds spiciness indicator" behavior:

```swift
func testWhenItemIsSpicyDisplayNameHasSpicinessIndicator() {
    let item = MenuItem(name: "a name", spicy: true)
    let displayName = item.displayName
    XCTAssertEqual(displayName, "a name üå∂")
}
```

The implementation for `displayName` is an if-else conditional logic based on the model's `spicy` property.

Do we need that conditional logic to make that single test pass just yet?
No, we can simply hardcode the result.

```swift
struct MenuItem {

    let name: String
    let spicy: Bool

    lazy private(set) var displayName: String = "\(name) üå∂"
}
```

Now that we have established the baseline for the correct behavior, we can refactor `displayName` to conditionally add the "üå∂".
Another option could be to move on with the next test, which will initially fail because of the hardcode implementation and require us to implement the conditional logic.

The difference between TDD and testing after the fact is that writing tests first introduces a helpful pressure to build small components in small iterations.
Applying YDNIY will make you get the most out of TDD.

**By only writing what is strictly necessary right now while leaving the door open for future changes, you can focus on solving one small problem at a time.**
**This is a psychological relief that should not be underestimated and a way to assign our limited working memory space effectively.**

The next time you'll write the code to make a failing test pass, ask yourself, "do I need it yet?"
Seek to write only as little code as necessary.

What are the techniques you use to get fast feedback when writing tests?

## Footnotes

<span id="fn-feedback-caveat">**1.**</span>
There is a caveat.
Unless you spent time doing customer research upfront and have assumptions to validate, that feedback might not be actionable.
Still, you'll definitely get more information on your code's behavior in the wild and what the users need from it than if you didn't ship it.

<span id="fn-example">**2.**</span>
In the book, this code actually lives in the `ViewModel` for the row displaying `MenuItem` in the menu list view.
I simplified it in this post into a dedicated method in the model itself to keep the code concise.
