RSS is a great way to stay up to date with your favourite blogs, and I don't care if the internet [seems to have decided that RSS is dead](http://techcrunch.com/2013/03/13/google-readers-death-is-proof-that-rss-always-suffered-from-lack-of-consumer-appeal/).

On the market there are a number of great RSS apps and web services, but what's better that make one your own?

Combining [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/recipes) and [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) you can create an automation pipeline to deliver your favourite blog's posts to your reading list.

## Setup

1. Choose the **RSS** Trigger Channel.
2. Choose **New feed item** as the Trigger.
3. Paste your favourite blog's RSS url in the **Feed URL** field.
4. Choose **Pocket** as the Action Channel.
5. Choose **Save for later** as the Action.
6. Populate the **Tags** as you think appropriate.
7. Hit the **Create Action** button.

You can use [this recipe](https://ifttt.com/recipes/330296-mokacoding-rss-to-pocket) to send new [mokacoding](https://mokacoding.com) posts to you Pocket reading list, and duplicate it to subscribe to your favourite blogs.

And you know what the cool thing? You can use this workflow with other channels, like [Readability](https://ifttt.com/readability), [Feedly](https://ifttt.com/feedly), the [iOS reading list](https://ifttt.com/ios_reading_list), [Instapaper](https://ifttt.com/instapaper), and many more.

Enjoy.
