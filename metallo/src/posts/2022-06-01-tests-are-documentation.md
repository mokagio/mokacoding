- Frontload: Tests are the best documentation. A well written tests shows you how to use the production code.
- When advocating testing, unit testing in particular, people focus on bugs or [TDD argument for better design]
- I was reminded and delighted of this recently when...
- https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/blob/e874a47c6e2e0e61590a03d3b71e75e5a505d1ce/fastlane/spec/fixtures/deprecated_actions/deprecated_action.rb
- A consequence of appreciating the value of tests as documentation is that you want to write tests that are as clear as possible
  - I'm sure there's something to plug here LINK
- And if you have good tests, hint practice TDD, you can also approach code review for new code starting by its tests.
- Conclusion: Tests are the gift that kepps on giving: they help you develop code with a faster feedback loop, architect well, and once you have them, are a living documentation for your production code. With so many benefits, it pays to write them, and to put in the extra time to write them well.
