title: The iOS 14 distraction conundrum
draft: true
---

This is a post I should actually write when iOS 14 is released.
The point is Apple is doing something cool with the bed time restrictions, but it's a bit like a scientist who created a too powerful montser and then tries to tame it.
At the same time, the introduction of the widgets in the apps screen has the opportunity to create a lot of distractions.

Unfortunately, it's not in Apple's interest to develop only focus-focused features, as their is a general purpose device.
But for the small -but slowly growing- group of users that care about their attention, this is a powerful reminder that a phone is a tool.
I'm sure I won't be using any widgets.
Be critical with new technologies, or in this case app features, and don't adopt them point blank just because they are there.
