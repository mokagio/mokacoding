Today I installed the latest beta version of Xcode, Xcode 7.3 beta 4. As usual
none of my plug-ins worked, which makes me really unproductive.

So I went back to [this post](https://www.mokacoding.com/blog/xcode-plugins-update/)
in which I showed how to update a plug-in to be compatible to the latest version
of Xcode. I made an handy script out of it that will update all plug-ins to
be compatible with the version of Xcode and Xcode-beta installed on your machine.

Here it is in [gist](https://gist.github.com/) form, so that this post will
always show an up to date version.
